Tailwind CSS 4.0 brings significant improvements to the utility-first CSS framework we know and love.

## What's New in v4?

The latest version includes a completely rewritten engine that's significantly faster and more capable.

### Key Improvements

- **New engine** - Up to 10x faster builds
- **CSS-first configuration** - Configure directly in CSS
- **Automatic content detection** - No more content configuration
- **Native cascade layers** - Better CSS organization

## Migration Guide

Upgrading is straightforward for most projects:

```bash
bun add tailwindcss@latest
```

Update your CSS to use the new import syntax:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

## Conclusion

Tailwind CSS 4.0 is a significant step forward. The performance improvements alone make it worth upgrading.

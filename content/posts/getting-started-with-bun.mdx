Bun is an all-in-one JavaScript runtime and toolkit designed for speed. It includes a bundler, test runner, and Node.js-compatible package manager.

## Why Bun?

Bun was built from scratch with performance in mind. It's written in Zig and uses JavaScriptCore instead of V8, which gives it a significant speed advantage in many scenarios.

### Key Features

- **Fast startup times** - Bun starts up to 4x faster than Node.js
- **Native TypeScript support** - No additional configuration needed
- **Built-in bundler** - Bundle your code without extra tools
- **npm compatible** - Use your existing packages seamlessly

## Getting Started

Installing Bun is straightforward:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Once installed, you can run JavaScript and TypeScript files directly:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

## Conclusion

Bun is a promising alternative to Node.js that offers significant performance improvements. Give it a try in your next project!

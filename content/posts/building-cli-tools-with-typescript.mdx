Command-line interfaces don't have to be boring. With Ink, you can build beautiful, interactive CLIs using React components.

## What is Ink?

Ink is a React renderer for the terminal. It lets you build CLI apps using components, just like you would build a web app.

### Why Use Ink?

- Familiar React component model
- Built-in hooks for input handling
- Flexbox layout support
- TypeScript support out of the box

## Creating Your First Ink App

Start by creating a new project:

```bash
mkdir my-cli && cd my-cli
bun init
bun add ink react
```

Then create your component:

```typescript
import { render, Text, Box } from 'ink';

function App() {
  return (
    <Box flexDirection="column">
      <Text color="green">Hello, CLI!</Text>
    </Box>
  );
}

render(<App />);
```

## Conclusion

Ink makes it easy to create professional CLI tools. The React paradigm translates surprisingly well to terminal interfaces.
